 Student-App
My Spreadtech Africa Final Project.
This program is created to create,read,update and delete students information which includes name of student,grade and age.
Credits go to SpreadTeach Africa for the bootcamp which was held so that we learn on how to use visual studio code in creating program with CRUD operations.
Thank you to Chiboy the facilitator of backend development lessons for taking us through the course and introduced us to communities like 'Medium' where i learnt alot of things on backend development.
I also thank Google for being there when i was trying to find out more about " how to".
